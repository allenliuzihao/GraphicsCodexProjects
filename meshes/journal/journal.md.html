2020-11-01: Checkpoint 6
=============================================================
![2.6 Demo](2020-11-01__009_2.6_Demo.jpg)

Another view


![2.6 Demo](2020-11-01__008_2.6_Demo.jpg)

Adding shading into the scene


![2.6 Demo](2020-11-01__007_2.6_Demo.jpg)

triangular glass.


![2.6 Demo](2020-11-01__006_2.6_Demo.jpg)

Adding transparency to the glass.


![2.6 Demo](2020-11-01__005_2.6_Demo.jpg)

Again with wireframe


![2.6 Demo](2020-11-01__004_2.6_Demo.jpg)

Wireframe removed and adding alpha transparency for the glass.



![2.6 Demo Scene](2020-11-01__003_2.6_Demo_Scene.jpg)

A view into my demo scene with geometries procedurally generated from this
project.


2020-11-01: Checkpoint 5
=============================================================
![2.5 Drinking Glass](2020-11-01__002_2.5_Drinking_Glass.jpg)

Adjusting the number of slices.


![2.5 Drinking class](2020-11-01__001_2.5_Drinking_class.jpg)

The glass is a closed surface and generated with a surface of revolution
algorithm.



![2.5 Drinking glass solids of revolution](2020-11-01__000_2.5_Drinking_glass_solids_of_revolution.jpg)

This drinking glass is implemented with a solids of revolution algorithm I
wrote. The input is an array of points describing the contour of the solid. The
glass is water tight and closed. 
In addition, I also added UI control to adjust
the number of slices


2020-10-26: Checkpoint 4
=============================================================
![2.4 Height field](2020-10-26__001_2.4_Height_field.jpg)

A close up view to my triangulated height field.



![2.4 Heightfield](2020-10-26__000_2.4_Heightfield.jpg)

For this checkpoint, I implemented an algorithm to generate heightfield given a
color image using its intensity values. The result is triangulated and displayed
as a height field.
The height field in this image is generated with the color
image of Ray Tracing in One Weekend.


2020-10-25: Checkpoint 3
=============================================================
![2.3 Very large cubes and cylinders](2020-10-25__005_2.3_Very_large_cubes_and_cylinders.jpg)


![2.3 another view into my geometries.](2020-10-25__004_2.3_another_view_into_my_geometries..jpg)

Cube can be enlarged as well.


![2.3 increasing the height and radius of the geometry.](2020-10-25__003_2.3_increasing_the_height_and_radius_of_the_geometry..jpg)

For this checkpoint, I added a GUI in G3D for adjusting Cube length and Cylinder
radius and height. Geometry changes are dynamically loaded into the scene.


2020-10-25: Checkpoint 1 and 2.
=============================================================
![2.1 and 2.2  Mesh Cubes and Cylinder](2020-10-25__001_2.1_and_2.2_Mesh_Cubes_and_Cylinder.jpg)

My cylinder generation algorithm is able to handle the cases when there is an
uneven distribution of rectangles centered at the circles.



![2.1 and 2.2 Mesh Cube and Cylinder](2020-10-25__000_2.1_and_2.2_Mesh_Cube_and_Cylinder.jpg)

This picture showcase my procedurally generated cube and cylinder.


2019-03-01: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press *F4* or *F6* in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to
this development journal.
