2020-10-25: Checkpoint 3
=============================================================
![2.3 Very large cubes and cylinders](2020-10-25__005_2.3_Very_large_cubes_and_cylinders.jpg)


![2.3 another view into my geometries.](2020-10-25__004_2.3_another_view_into_my_geometries..jpg)

Cube can be enlarged as well.


![2.3 increasing the height and radius of the geometry.](2020-10-25__003_2.3_increasing_the_height_and_radius_of_the_geometry..jpg)

For this checkpoint, I added a GUI in G3D for adjusting Cube length and Cylinder
radius and height. Geometry changes are dynamically loaded into the scene.


2020-10-25: Checkpoint 1 and 2.
=============================================================
![2.1 and 2.2  Mesh Cubes and Cylinder](2020-10-25__001_2.1_and_2.2_Mesh_Cubes_and_Cylinder.jpg)

My cylinder generation algorithm is able to handle the cases when there is an
uneven distribution of rectangles centered at the circles.

This picture showcase my procedurally generated cube and cylinder.


2019-03-01: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press *F4* or *F6* in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to
this development journal.
